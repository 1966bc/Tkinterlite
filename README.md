Hi all, here we are!

tkinterlite, (Tkinter Sqlite) is my personal study on python 3.4.2 tkinter and sqlite, and by the way the beginning of my

adventure with git-hub.

To run the project, execute tkinterlite.py , something like...

bc@hal9000:~/Tkinterlite-master$ python3 tkinterlite.py 

enjoy yourself
