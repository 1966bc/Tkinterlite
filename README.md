Winter 2018
Heavy refactoring, change thread, it doesn't jam anymore now ;)

Just go to the class ClockThread in main.py file.

Hi all, here we are!

tkinterlite, (Tkinter Sqlite) is my personal study on python 3.4.2 tkinter and sqlite, and by the way the beginning of my adventure with git-hub.

To run the project, execute tkinterlite.py , something like...

bc@hal9000:~/tkinterlite$ python3 tkinterlite.py 

enjoy yourself
